# mini_project
#Description: The aim of this project is to develop a music playing application were one can jam with family, friends and new people. 

Css Used:
Css grid is used to display music cards which holds music files.
Css flex is used in dashboard and content section so that we can make our page as responsive as possible
transition & pseudo class: These both are used to enhance the user experience and to give a dynamic effect to our website

Problem Faced:
One of the major problem I faced was to assembling and navigating the css and the element. There were a lot code in a single file
such that I was not able to find the elements.

Solution:
To resolve the upper solution I break the project in 3 parts

Dashboard-----Left Box-------Right Box

I wrote seprate HTML and CSS for all three elemets and this helped me a lot in managing the structure, doing changes and finding elements.




HOW TO USE THE WEBSITE?
Using Swing Music Player is simple, it's intutive and you just need to navigate to the song you want to listen and click play to sooth your mood.
